## Overview

`tracing` is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
structured, event-based diagnostic information. `tracing` is maintained by the
Tokio project, but does _not_ require the `tokio` runtime to be used.

## Usage

### In libraries

Libraries should only rely on the `tracing` crate and use the provided macros
and types to collect whatever information might be useful to downstream consumers.

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing = "0.1"
```

```rust
use std::{error::Error, io};
use tracing::{debug, error, info, span, warn, Level, instrument};

#[instrument]
pub fn shave(yak: usize) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error + 'static>> {
    debug!(excitement = "yay!", "hello! I'm gonna shave a yak.");
    if yak == 3 {
        warn!("could not locate yak!");
        // note that this is intended to demonstrate `tracing`'s features, not idiomatic
        // error handling! in a library or application, you should consider returning
        // a dedicated `YakError`. libraries like snafu or thiserror make this easy.
        return Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "shaving yak failed!").into());
    } else {
        debug!("yak shaved successfully");
    }
    Ok(())
}

pub fn shave_all(yaks: usize) -> usize {
    let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "shaving_yaks", yaks);
    let _enter = span.enter();

    info!("shaving yaks");

    let mut yaks_shaved = 0;
    for yak in 1..=yaks {
        let res = shave(yak);
        debug!(yak, shaved = res.is_ok());

        if let Err(ref error) = res {
            error!(yak, error = error.as_ref(), "failed to shave yak!");
        } else {
            yaks_shaved += 1;
        }
        debug!(yaks_shaved);
    }

    yaks_shaved
}
```

### In applications

In order to produce output, applications need a concrete subscriber implementation. 
[`tracing_subscriber`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/) is a reasonable default.
By default, `tracing-subscriber` is able to consume messages emitted by
`log`-instrumented libraries and modules.

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = "0.2.0-alpha.2"
```

```rust
use tracing::{info, Level};
use tracing_subscriber;
mod yak_shave;

fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt::Subscriber::builder()
        // all spans/events with a level higher than `DEBUG` (e.g, info, warn, etc.)
        // will be written to stdout.
        .with_max_level(Level::DEBUG)
        // sets this to be the default, global subscriber for this application.
        .init();

    let number_of_yaks = 3;
    info!(number_of_yaks, "preparing to shave yaks");

    let number_shaved = yak_shave::shave_all(number_of_yaks);
    info!(
        all_yaks_shaved = number_shaved == number_of_yaks,
        "yak shaving completed."
    );
}
```

### Additional Notes

#### Usage in Asynchronous Code

If you are instrumenting libraries or applications that make use of [`std::future::Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html) or async/await, be sure to use the [`tracing-futures`](https://docs.rs/tracing-futures) crate. There are two ways to instrument asynchronous code. The first is through the [`#[instrument]`](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.11/tracing/attr.instrument.html) attribute:

```rust
use tracing::{info, instrument};
use tokio::{io::AsyncWriteExt, net::TcpStream};
use std::io;

#[instrument]
async fn write(stream: &mut TcpStream) -> io::Result<usize> {
    let result = stream.write(b"hello world\n").await;
    info!("wrote to stream; success={:?}", result.is_ok());
    result
}
```

The second is through the [`Future::instrument`](https://docs.rs/tracing-futures/0.2.0/tracing_futures/trait.Instrument.html#method.instrument) combinator:

```rust
use tracing_futures::Instrument;

let my_future = async {
    // ...
};

my_future
    .instrument(tracing::info_span!("my_future"))
    .await
```

## Getting Help

First, see if the answer to your question can be found in the API documentation.
If the answer is not there, there is an active community in
the [Tracing Discord channel][chat]. We would be happy to try to answer your
question.  Last, if that doesn't work, try opening an [issue] with the question.

## Project layout

The [`tracing`] crate contains the primary _instrumentation_ API, used for
instrumenting libraries and applications to emit trace data. The [`tracing-core`]
crate contains the _core_ API primitives on which the rest of `tracing` is
instrumented. Authors of trace subscribers may depend on `tracing-core`, which
guarantees a higher level of stability.

Additionally, this repository contains several compatibility and utility
libraries built on top of `tracing`. Some of these crates are in a pre-release
state, and are less stable than the `tracing` and `tracing-core` crates.

The crates included as part of Tracing are:

* [`tracing-futures`]: Utilities for instrumenting `futures`.
  ([crates.io][fut-crates]|[docs][fut-docs])

* [`tracing-macros`]: Experimental macros for emitting trace events (unstable).

* [`tracing-attributes`]: Procedural macro attributes for automatically
    instrumenting functions. ([crates.io][attr-crates]|[docs][attr-docs])

* [`tracing-log`]: Compatibility with the `log` crate (unstable).

* [`tracing-serde`]: A compatibility layer for serializing trace data with
    `serde` (unstable).

* [`tracing-subscriber`]: Subscriber implementations, and utilities for
  implementing and composing `Subscriber`s.
  ([crates.io][sub-crates]|[docs][sub-docs])

* [`tracing-tower`]: Compatibility with the `tower` ecosystem (unstable).
