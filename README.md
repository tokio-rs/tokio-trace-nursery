## Overview

`tracing` is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
structured, event-based diagnostic information. `tracing` is maintained by the
Tokio project, but does _not_ require the `tokio` runtime to be used.

## Getting Help

First, see if the answer to your question can be found in the API documentation.
If the answer is not there, there is an active community in
the [Tracing Gitter channel][chat]. We would be happy to try to answer your
question.  Last, if that doesn't work, try opening an [issue] with the question.

## Contributing

:balloon: Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have
you! We have a [contributing guide][guide] to help you get involved in the Tracing
project.

## Project layout

The [`tracing`] crate contains the primary _instrumentation_ API, used for
instrumenting libraries and applications to emit trace data. The [`tracing-core`]
crate contains the _core_ API primitives on which the rest of `tracing` is
instrumented. Authors of trace subscribers may depend on `tracing-core`, which
guarantees a higher level of stability.

Additionally, this repository contains several compatibility and utility
libraries built on top of `tracing`. Some of these crates are in a pre-release
state, and are less stable than the `tracing` and `tracing-core` crates.

The crates included as part of Tracing are:

* [`tracing-fmt`]: A subscriber for formatting and logging trace events.

* [`tracing-futures`]: Utilities for instrumenting `futures` (unstable).

* [`tracing-macros`]: Experimental macros for emitting trace events (unstable).

* [`tracing-proc-macros`]: Procedural macro attributes for automatically
    instrumenting functions (unstable).

* [`tracing-log`]: Compatibility with the `log` crate (unstable).

* [`tracing-env-logger`]: A subscriber that logs trace events using the
    `env_logger` crate (unstable).

* [`tracing-serde`]: A compatibility layer for serializing trace data with
    `serde` (unstable).

* [`tracing-subscriber`]: Utilities for subscriber implementations (unstable).

* [`tracing-tower`]: Compatibility with the `tower` ecosystem (unstable).

* [`tracing-tower-http`]: `tower` compatibility for HTTP services (unstable).
