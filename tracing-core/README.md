## Overview

`tracing` is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
structured, event-based diagnostic information. This crate defines the core
primitives of `tracing`.

The crate provides:

* [`Span`] identifies a span within the execution of a program.

* [`Event`] represents a single event within a trace.

* [`Subscriber`], the trait implemented to collect trace data.

* [`Metadata`] and [`Callsite`] provide information describing `Span`s.

* [`Field`], [`FieldSet`], [`Value`], and [`ValueSet`] represent the
  structured data attached to a `Span`.

* [`Dispatch`] allows span events to be dispatched to `Subscriber`s.

In addition, it defines the global callsite registry and per-thread current
dispatcher which other components of the tracing system rely on.

Application authors will typically not use this crate directly. Instead, they
will use the [`tracing`] crate, which provides a much more fully-featured
API. However, this crate's API will change very infrequently, so it may be used
when dependencies must be very stable.
