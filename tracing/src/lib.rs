//! A scoped, structured logging and diagnostics system.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! `tracing` is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
//! structured, event-based diagnostic information.
//!
//! In asynchronous systems like Tokio, interpreting traditional log messages can
//! often be quite challenging. Since individual tasks are multiplexed on the same
//! thread, associated events and log lines are intermixed making it difficult to
//! trace the logic flow. `tracing` expands upon logging-style diagnostics by
//! allowing libraries and applications to record structured events with additional
//! information about *temporality* and *causality* — unlike a log message, a span
//! in `tracing` has a beginning and end time, may be entered and exited by the
//! flow of execution, and may exist within a nested tree of similar spans. In
//! addition, `tracing` spans are *structured*, with the ability to record typed
//! data as well as textual messages.
//!
//! The `tracing` crate provides the APIs necessary for instrumenting libraries
//! and applications to emit trace data.
//!
//! # Core Concepts
//!
//! The core of `tracing`'s API is composed of _spans_, _events_ and
//! _subscribers_. We'll cover these in turn.
//!
//! ## Spans
//!
//! A [`span`] represents a _period of time_ during which a program was executing
//! in some context. A thread of execution is said to _enter_ a span when it
//! begins executing in that context, and to _exit_ the span when switching to
//! another context. The span in which a thread is currently executing is
//! referred to as the _current_ span.
//!
//! For example:
//! ```
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate tracing;
//!
//! use tracing::Level;
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my_span");
//! // `enter` returns a RAII guard which, when dropped, exits the span. this
//! // indicates that we are in the span for the current lexical scope.
//! let _enter = span.enter();
//! // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
//! # }
//!```
//!
//! The [`span` module]'s documentation provides further details on how to use spans.
//!
//! ## Events
//!
//! An [`Event`] represents a _point_ in time. It signifies something that
//! happened while the trace was executing. `Event`s are comparable to the log
//! records emitted by unstructured logging code, but unlike a typical log line,
//! an `Event` may occur within the context of a `Span`. Like a `Span`, it
//! may have fields, and implicitly inherits any of the fields present on its
//! parent span.
//!
//! For example:
//! ```
//! # #[macro_use] extern crate tracing;
//! # use tracing::Level;
//! # fn main() {
//! // records an event outside of any span context:
//! event!(Level::INFO, "something happened");
//!
//! span!(Level::INFO, "my_span").in_scope(|| {
//!     // records an event within "my_span".
//!     event!(Level::DEBUG, "something happened inside my_span");
//! });
//! # }
//!```
//!
//! Essentially, `Event`s  bridge the gap between traditional unstructured
//! logging and span-based tracing. Similar to log records, they
//! may be recorded at a number of levels, and can have unstructured,
//! human-readable messages; however, they also carry key-value data and exist
//! within the context of the tree of spans that comprise a trace. Thus,
//! individual log record-like events can be pinpointed not only in time, but
//! in the logical execution flow of the system.
//!
//! In general, events should be used to represent points in time _within_ a
//! span — a request returned with a given status code, _n_ new items were
//! taken from a queue, and so on.
//!
//! ## `Subscriber`s
//!
//! As `Span`s and `Event`s occur, they are recorded or aggregated by
//! implementations of the [`Subscriber`] trait. `Subscriber`s are notified
//! when an `Event` takes place and when a `Span` is entered or exited. These
//! notifications are represented by the following `Subscriber` trait methods:
//! + [`observe_event`], called when an `Event` takes place,
//! + [`enter`], called when execution enters a `Span`,
//! + [`exit`], called when execution exits a `Span`
//!
//! In addition, subscribers may implement the [`enabled`] function to _filter_
//! the notifications they receive based on [metadata] describing each `Span`
//! or `Event`. If a call to `Subscriber::enabled` returns `false` for a given
//! set of metadata, that `Subscriber` will *not* be notified about the
//! corresponding `Span` or `Event`. For performance reasons, if no currently
//! active subscribers express  interest in a given set of metadata by returning
//! `true`, then the corresponding `Span` or `Event` will never be constructed.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! tracing = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! Next, add this to your crate:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate tracing;
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! `Span`s are constructed using the `span!` macro, and then _entered_
//! to indicate that some code takes place within the context of that `Span`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use]
//! # extern crate tracing;
//! # use tracing::Level;
//! # fn main() {
//! // Construct a new span named "my span" with trace log level.
//! let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my span");
//!
//! // Enter the span, returning a guard object.
//! let _enter = span.enter();
//!
//! // Any trace events that occur before the guard is dropped will occur
//! // within the span.
//!
//! // Dropping the guard will exit the span.
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! `Event`s are created using the `event!` macro, and are recorded when the
//! event is dropped:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[macro_use]
//! # extern crate tracing;
//! # fn main() {
//! use tracing::Level;
//! event!(Level::INFO, "something has happened!");
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Users of the [`log`] crate should note that `tracing` exposes a set of
//! macros for creating `Event`s (`trace!`, `debug!`, `info!`, `warn!`, and
//! `error!`) which may be invoked with the same syntax as the similarly-named
//! macros from the `log` crate. Often, the process of converting a project to
//! use `tracing` can begin with a simple drop-in replacement.
//!
//! Let's consider the `log` crate's yak-shaving example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate tracing;
//! use tracing::Level;
//!
//! # #[derive(Debug)] pub struct Yak(String);
//! # impl Yak { fn shave(&mut self, _: u32) {} }
//! # fn find_a_razor() -> Result<u32, u32> { Ok(1) }
//! # fn main() {
//! pub fn shave_the_yak(yak: &mut Yak) {
//!     let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "shave_the_yak", ?yak);
//!     let _enter = span.enter();
//!
//!     // Since the span is annotated with the yak, it is part of the context
//!     // for everything happening inside the span. Therefore, we don't need
//!     // to add it to the message for this event, as the `log` crate does.
//!     info!(target: "yak_events", "Commencing yak shaving");
//!     loop {
//!         match find_a_razor() {
//!             Ok(razor) => {
//!                 // We can add the razor as a field rather than formatting it
//!                 // as part of the message, allowing subscribers to consume it
//!                 // in a more structured manner:
//!                 info!({ %razor }, "Razor located");
//!                 yak.shave(razor);
//!                 break;
//!             }
//!             Err(err) => {
//!                 // However, we can also create events with formatted messages,
//!                 // just as we would for log records.
//!                 warn!("Unable to locate a razor: {}, retrying", err);
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! You can find examples showing how to use this crate in the examples
//! directory.
//!
//! ## In libraries
//!
//! Libraries should link only to the `tracing` crate, and use the provided
//! macros to record whatever information will be useful to downstream
//! consumers.
//!
//! ## In executables
//!
//! In order to record trace events, executables have to use a `Subscriber`
//! implementation compatible with `tracing`. A `Subscriber` implements a
//! way of collecting trace data, such as by logging it to standard output.
//!
//! The simplest way to use a subscriber is to call the [`set_global_default`]
//! function:
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate tracing;
//! # pub struct FooSubscriber;
//! # use tracing::{span::{Id, Attributes, Record}, Metadata};
//! # impl tracing::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {
//! #   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }
//! #   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}
//! #   fn event(&self, _: &tracing::Event) {}
//! #   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }
//! #   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! # }
//! # impl FooSubscriber {
//! #   fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber }
//! # }
//! # fn main() {
//!
//! let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(my_subscriber)
//!     .expect("setting tracing default failed");
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! **Note:** Libraries should *NOT* call `set_global_default()`! That will
//! cause conflicts when executables try to set the default later.
//!
//! This subscriber will be used as the default in all threads for the
//! remainder of the duration of the program, similar to setting the logger
//! in the `log` crate.
//!
//! In addition, the default subscriber can be set through using the
//! [`with_default`] function. This follows the `tokio` pattern of using
//! closures to represent executing code in a context that is exited at the end
//! of the closure. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate tracing;
//! # pub struct FooSubscriber;
//! # use tracing::{span::{Id, Attributes, Record}, Metadata};
//! # impl tracing::Subscriber for FooSubscriber {
//! #   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(0) }
//! #   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}
//! #   fn event(&self, _: &tracing::Event) {}
//! #   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }
//! #   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! # }
//! # impl FooSubscriber {
//! #   fn new() -> Self { FooSubscriber }
//! # }
//! # fn main() {
//!
//! let my_subscriber = FooSubscriber::new();
//!
//! tracing::subscriber::with_default(my_subscriber, || {
//!     // Any trace events generated in this closure or by functions it calls
//!     // will be collected by `my_subscriber`.
//! })
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This approach allows trace data to be collected by multiple subscribers
//! within different contexts in the program. Note that the override only applies to the
//! currently executing thread; other threads will not see the change from with_default.
//! with that subscriber as the default.
//!
//! Any trace events generated outside the
//! context of a subscriber will not be collected.
//!
//! The executable itself may use the `tracing` crate to instrument itself
//! as well.
//!
//! In addition to `tracing` and `tracing-core`, the [`tokio-rs/tracing`] repository
//! several additional crates designed to be used with the `tracing` ecosystem.
//! This includes a collection of `Subscriber` implementations, as well as utility
//! and adapter crates to assist in writing `Subscriber`s and instrumenting
//! applications.
//!
//! In particular, the following `tracing` crates are likely to be of interest:
//!
//! - [`tracing-futures`] provides a compatibility layer with the `futures`
//!   crate, allowing spans to be attached to `Future`s, `Stream`s, and `Executor`s.
//! - [`tracing-fmt`] provides a `Subscriber` implementation for
//!   logging formatted trace data to stdout, with similar filtering and
//!   formatting to the `env-logger` crate.
//! - [`tracing-log`] provides a compatibility layer with the `log` crate,
//!   allowing log `Record`s to be recorded as `tracing` `Event`s within the
//!   trace tree. This is useful when a project using `tracing` have
//!   dependencies which use `log`.
//!
//! **Note:** that some of the ecosystem crates are currently unreleased and
//! undergoing active development. They may be less stable than `tracing` and
//! `tracing-core`.
//!
//! ##  Crate Feature Flags
//!
//! The following crate feature flags are available:
//!
//! * A set of features controlling the [static verbosity level].
//! * `log` causes trace instrumentation points to emit [`log`] records as well
//!   as trace events. This is inteded for use in libraries whose users may be
//!   using either `tracing` or `log`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! tracing = { version = "0.1", features = ["log"] }
