## Overview

[`tracing`][tracing] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs with context-aware,
structured, event-based diagnostic information. This crate provides an
implementation of the [`Subscriber`] trait that records `tracing`'s `Event`s
and `Span`s by formatting them as text and logging them to stdout.
